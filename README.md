# Controlled Vocabulary for School Librarianship

📖 **Case Study – Information Architecture & Taxonomy Design**

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design of a controlled vocabulary to support MLIS students training as school librarians. The goal was to improve metadata quality, consistency, and discoverability of resources across K–12 contexts.

## Process
- Extracted key concepts from scholarly sources.  
- Normalized terms, consolidated duplicates, and defined preferred labels.  
- Wrote scope notes for clarity of use.  
- Established hierarchical relationships (BT/NT/RT).  
- Packaged terms in a professional table for portfolio presentation.  

## Deliverables
- 🗂️ [Controlled Vocabulary Case Study (PDF)](deliverables/Controlled_Vocabulary_Case_Study.pdf)  
- 📄 [Controlled Vocabulary Case Study (DOCX)](deliverables/Controlled_Vocabulary_Case_Study.docx)  
- 📊 [Controlled Vocabulary Table (CSV)](deliverables/Controlled_Vocabulary_Table.csv)  

## Impact
The final vocabulary provided:
- Improved consistency across 10+ records.  
- A reusable framework for indexing school library resources.  
- Evidence of applied skills in taxonomy design, metadata, and information architecture.
